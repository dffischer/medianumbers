# Medianumbers

This repository collects small scripts and outgrown aliases for the query and manipulation of video and audio time codes, durations and aspect ratios. It mostly wraps and thus depends on [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/).


## Installation

The scripts can be used as they are here, or copied somewhere in your `$PATH` for frequent use.
