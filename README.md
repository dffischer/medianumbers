# Medianumbers

This repository collects small scripts and outgrown aliases for the query and manipulation of video and audio time codes, durations and aspect ratios. It mostly wraps and thus depends on [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/). Time is usually formatted as `hh:mm:ss.ff`, in hours, minutes, seconds and optional centiseconds.

- **duration** queries the play length of a file.

- **sum-time** adds up timecodes.


## Installation

The scripts can be used as they are here, or copied somewhere in your `$PATH` for frequent use.
